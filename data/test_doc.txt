The first round of the 2024 NBA playoffs is in the books save for one series: Orlando is at Cleveland for Game 7 on Sunday, with the winner earning the distinct pleasure of facing the Celtics in the conference semis. So far, we have had two seeding upsets, with the No. 5 Mavericks eliminating the No. 4 Clippers and the No. 6 Pacers taking out the No. 3 Bucks. No. 5 Orlando could be the third to erase some chalk.

Moving forward, these second-round series, as the kids would say, look like fire. Minnesota vs. Denver kicks off second-round action Saturday night, and I'm here to tell you the Timberwolves are for real with the bodies to match up with Nikola Jokic and the pressure perimeter defense to make life difficult on Jamal Murray.

The second West semifinal is No. 5 Dallas vs. No. 1 Oklahoma City. That series speaks for itself. 

In the East, we have a throwback to the Reggie Miller/Patrick Ewing wars of the 90s with the No. 2 Knicks taking on the No. 6 Pacers. Below, our experts have weighed in with their predictions for each of the three series that we know of to this point. When we find out who is playing Boston, those picks will be along shortly after.
