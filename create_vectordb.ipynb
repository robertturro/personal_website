      "If the movie title cannot be found or if the release date is incorrect the program will output “Movie Not Found. Make Sure Spelling And Release Date Are Correct”. The release date of the movie is needed because there are many movies with the same title, the release date helps ensure that the correct movie is found within the movie dictionary. Once the movie index is found the genres and original language of the movie are also found. Next the program begins the rules based approach of recommending a movie. All movies with the same genre as the input movie are found and stored in a list. Then the movies are filtered based on the release year in which movies with a similar release year are added to a second list. Next the movies are filtered on language in which only the movies with the same original language are added to a third list. Lastly the remaining movies are added to a dictionary and sorted by popularity. The movie with the highest popularity, given it is not the input movie, is returned to the user along with an overview of the movie.\n",
